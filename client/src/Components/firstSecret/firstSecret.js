  //THOUGHTS: I had to use a strange onclick method, specifically onMouseDown,
  // cont. onClick would not work for some reason. Maybe it can't work on moving
  // cont. elements, thought I can't really imagine why. I hovered over the moving
  // cont. Image in the elements tab of console, and it was following it.

  //DESC: runs the animation everytime the screen is entered/rendered

  //THOUGHTS: I need to look up, possibly in animations, for a way to make a element move away from your cursor,
  // cont. but at a static speed. Need it to be static so it's, well... possible
  //THOUGHTS2: Not sure how I feel about putting all the instructions on one line.
  // cont. on one hand, less likely to completely break to dimension changes, but, well,
  // cont. it looks super ugly in vs code. Also, I can't space the lines farther than they
  // cont. already are(to my knowledge)
