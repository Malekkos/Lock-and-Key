  //THOUGHTS2: Not sure how I feel about putting all the instructions on one line.
  // cont. on one hand, less likely to completely break to dimension changes, but, well,
  // cont. it looks super ugly in vs code. Also, I can't space the lines farther than they
  // cont. already are(to my knowledge)
