  // cont. large company. In this environemnt, its not biggy, but food for thought nontheless.
  // cont. And, the only reason we were including token was so that I could manually grab it and
  // cont. test it with postman, so I think I can safely remove it. TBD.
  //IDEAS: Set a timer on greetingMessage, maybe a fade animation idk
  // cont. need to make the catch make a call to the error setter function and have it display the
  // cont. login error, incorrect creds in this situation. That does remind me, I think I have to 
  // cont. make some changes to an actual server fail, not bad creds. I'll have to, at some point, 
  // cont. try to run this without the server running. But then how would it get the custom message
  // cont. from it, if server isn't running? TBD

  //DESC: Main meat of the home page
  //THOUGHTS: Looks like I'll probably do the same thing I did with error that I will with putting secrets.
  // cont. Possibly, I'll make it so you have to hover over the lock, after verifying, and have a little box
  // cont. come out that has the secret data? It could save on space and the brain crushing effort of doing 
  // cont. max-width changes on my css files. Those get tedious QUICK, and make refactoring a pain.
  //THOUGHTS 2: I do believe there is id's and name and whatnot that literally do nothing, I'll have to scrape over this
  // cont. file later and find them.
  //THOUGHTS 3: I've been using one style, on class authMods, to style a few different things. Should I change that?
  // cont. They are intended to be static stylings, but its probably better for readability sake if I give them their
  // cont. own descriptive classes. This is for the future, definitely. Thats a reminder, I should maybe, well, definitely
  // cont. make some more css files. Putting them all in App.css is just lazy. Issue is, I don't really know how to make that
  // cont. conversion in the html stuff(or if its even possible). Worst case, I seperate the mountains of styling by lines
