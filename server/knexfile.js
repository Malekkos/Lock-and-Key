// THOUGHTS: I have a fairly okay understanding of most of this, but not pool. Like, I know that it makes foreign keys work, but HOW does it do it?
// cont: Should look into it.

// Config for the database
const sharedConfig = {
  client: 'better-sqlite3',
  useNullAsDefault: true,
  migrations: {
    directory: './data/migrations',
  },
  seeds: {
    directory: './data/seeds',
  },
  pool: {
    // afterCreate: (conn, done) => {
    //   conn.run('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON', done)
    // },
  },
}

module.exports = {
  development: {
    ...sharedConfig,
    connection: { filename: './data/auth.db3' },

    ...sharedConfig,
