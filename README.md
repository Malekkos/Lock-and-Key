TODO Today: 

 ~~ Convert over from node-sqlite3 to better-sqlite3

TODO LATER: 

 ~~ Develop the second game

 ~~ Persistent state would still be cool & ideal, but we dont have to worry about farming permissions anymore.

 ~~ Currently, any input for registering an account is accepted; this is dumb. Need to set some min req's, as well as some max's.

 ~~ Get into changing the css styling to conform to smaller devices

 ~~ Add disability compatibility. Need to check the guidelines for that stuff.
