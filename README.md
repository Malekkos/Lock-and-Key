TODO Today: 

 ~~ TBD

TODO LATER: 

 ~~ Okay, so, the issue was because the frontend was a static site. I get that now. New issue; I'm getting network errors when I try to hit my endpoints using login and register. I have an idea of what I could do to fix that, which making the actions asynchronous. I've noticed when loading into the page, it takes milennia, so im thinking that its trying to resolve something on my page without actually being finished with its call, hence the network error.

 ~~ Develop the second game

 ~~ Persistent state would still be cool & ideal, but we dont have to worry about farming permissions anymore.

 ~~ Currently, any input for registering an account is accepted; this is dumb. Need to set some min req's, as well as some max's.

 ~~ Get into changing the css styling to conform to smaller devices

 ~~ Add disability compatibility. Need to check the guidelines for that stuff.
